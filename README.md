Employee Summary Template

Build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.

**User Story**

I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

Stuck for now. List in VS code of errors and additional code needed/changed to run it.
